When I write a longer text, I tend to use a top-down approach. I begin 
writing down the headings. I then outline each section. Next, I write 
down keywords for each paragraph etc. At each step, I increase the 
indentation level (multiples of 'shiftwidth', see also 'fold-indent').

This plugin help maintaining an overview of the document by setting a 
paragraph's 'foldlevel' based on its indentation level -- see 
|:Indentfolds|. Other than vim's own 'fold-indent' method, any 
indentation level can be assigned as the top fold level. E.g. text with 
a prefix of 16 whitespace characters can be defined as level 1, 8 and 24 
whitespace characters would then be at level 2 etc.

This plugin also provides a helper-command to comment out or delete all 
lines at higher fold levels -- see |:IndentfoldsComment|.

Users can also use key maps (default: <tab>, <s-tab>) to cycle between 
indentation levels.
