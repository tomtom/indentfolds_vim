*indentfolds.txt*   Indentation-level based folds with a twist
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

When I write a longer text, I tend to use a top-down approach. I begin 
with writing down the headings. I then outline each section. Next, I write 
down keywords for each paragraph etc. At each step, I increase the 
indentation level (multiples of 'shiftwidth', see also 'fold-indent').

This plugin help maintaining an overview of the document by setting a 
paragraph's 'foldlevel' based on its indentation level -- see 
|:Indentfolds|. Other than vim's own 'fold-indent' method, any 
indentation level can be assigned as the top fold level. E.g. text with 
a prefix of 16 whitespace characters can be defined as level 1, 8 and 24 
whitespace characters would then be at level 2 etc. By setting foldlevel=1, 
only text at that indentation level is displayed.

This plugin also provides a helper-command to comment out or delete all 
lines at higher fold levels -- see |:IndentfoldsComment|.

Users can also use key maps (default: <tab>, <s-tab>) to cycle through 
indentation levels.

                                                    *:Indentfolds*
:Indentfolds LEVEL [FOLDLEVEL=g:indentfolds#foldlevel]
    See |indentfolds#Fold()| for help on LEVEL.
    FOLDLEVEL defaults to |g:indentfolds#foldlevel|.

                                                    *:IndentfoldsComment*
:IndentfoldsComment [LEVEL=2]
    Comment out all lines with fold level LEVEL or greater.
    Requires |g:indentfolds#comment_command| to be set.

                                                    *g:indentfolds#cycleplus_map*
g:indentfolds#cycleplus_map    (default: '<tab>')
    Use this map for cycling through indentation levels (focus lower 
    section levels).

                                                    *g:indentfolds#cycleminus_map*
g:indentfolds#cycleminus_map   (default: '<s-tab>')
    Use this map for cycling through indentation levels (focus higher 
    section levels).

                                                    *g:indentfolds#foldlevel*
g:indentfolds#foldlevel        (default: 2)
    If >= 0, |indentfolds#Fold()| sets 'foldlevel' to this value.

                                                    *g:indentfolds#comment_command*
g:indentfolds#comment_command  (default: ...)
    An ex-command to evaluate on a range of lines in order to comment 
    that lines out.
    
    If the tcomment plugin is installed, this defaults to:
      TComment!
    Otherwise, commenting is disabled.
    
    You can set this variable to "delete" to delete lines instead of 
    commenting them out.

                                                    *indentfolds#Fold()*
indentfolds#Fold(LEVELS, foldlevel=g:indentfolds#foldlevel)
    Set the indentation levels (see also |fold-indent|) that should be 
    considered a top level fold. The fold level is the smallest difference 
    between the current line's indentation level and the levels set with 
    this function.
    
    The LEVELS argument can have the following forms:
      LEVEL     ... Indentation LEVEL is fold level 1
      LOW-HIGH  ... Indentation levels from LOW to HIGH are fold level 1
      L1,L2,... ... Indentation levels L1, L2 etc. are fold level 1

                                                    *indentfolds#Comment()*
indentfolds#Comment(LEVEL)
    Comment out lines whose fold level is greater or equal the LEVEL 
    argument.

                                                    *indentfolds#Expr()*
indentfolds#Expr(lnum)

                                                    *indentfolds#Cycle()*
indentfolds#Cycle(delta)
